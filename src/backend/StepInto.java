/**
 *Executes code one statement at a time.

When not in design mode, Step Into enters
 * break mode at the current line of execution.
 * If the statement is a call to a procedure, 
 * the next statement displayed is the first 
 * statement in the procedure.

At design time, this menu item begins execution
 * and enters break mode before the first line 
 * of code is executed.

If there is no current execution point, the Step
 * Into command may appear to do nothing until 
 * you do something that triggers code, for example
 * click on a document.
